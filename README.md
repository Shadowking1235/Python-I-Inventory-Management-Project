# Inventory-Management-Project
Final project for CIT 144 - Python I class

For this project I chose to create a simple GUI based Inventory Management Program that controls product inventory.  This program will keep a running total of all items in the inventory as well as item data such as item number, item name, on hand amount and price.  This program will allow for adding items, editing items and deleting items within the inventory.  The data inputted is currenty volatile but in the future I would like to add a store feature.

Future Potential Updates:

Database/text file to store Inventory
Better sytling
Multiple pages for each function (add/edit)
